RISK is a classic board game with the objective of eliminating your opponents.
This objective is achieved by conquering all your opponents territories, which are decided by battles.
On a player's turn, they may choose to attack an adjacent opponent's territory with an army located in adjacent territory.
The attacking and defending player has a number of troops in their army located in their respective territories.
The players then perform a series of battles to determine if the attacked territory is defended or conquered.
Each battle is performed through dice rolls, which determines how many troops are lost in the battle, up to 2 on either side.
The final outcome of the attack is determined by the result of all the battles, typically with one side losing all their troops.
Although the probabilities of an individual battle are relatively straight forward to calculate, the probability of conquering a territory is not so clear
Since the starting conditions of a battle is determined by the results of the previous battle, these conditions can be naturally represented with an absorbing Markov chain.
In this project, Markov chain theory will be applied to the game of RISK.
